# Smart Detector

A decentralized health metrics management platform leveraging Clarity smart contracts on Stacks to enable secure, privacy-preserving personal health data tracking.

## Overview

Smart Detector is an innovative blockchain-powered solution designed to revolutionize personal health data management:

- üîí Secure and immutable health metric storage
- üìä Comprehensive health tracking capabilities
- üõ°Ô∏è Fine-grained privacy controls
- ü§ñ Automated data validation mechanisms
- üîç Transparent and user-controlled data sharing

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contracts that work together to create a secure and privacy-focused health monitoring system:

### health-data-registry
Core contract that manages user registration and permissions for health data access. Features include:
- User registration and identity management
- Fine-grained data access controls
- Permission management for different data categories
- Time-bound access grants

### vitals-tracker
Handles the recording and monitoring of vital signs and health metrics. Capabilities include:
- Recording multiple types of vital measurements
- Chronological history tracking
- Data validation and verification
- Statistical analysis of health trends

### provider-authorization
Manages healthcare provider identities and authorized access to patient data. Key features:
- Provider registration and verification
- Access request management
- Time-bound access controls
- Emergency access provisions

### health-alerts
Enables proactive health monitoring through customizable alerts. Functions include:
- Custom threshold definition
- Real-time alert generation
- Alert severity levels
- Healthcare provider notifications

## Data Categories

The platform supports various health data categories:
- Vital Signs (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)
- Lab Results
- Medications
- Medical History

## Permission Levels

Three levels of data access permissions:
- Read: View-only access to specific data
- Write: Ability to add new records
- Full: Complete access to manage data

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Register users through the health-data-registry contract
3. Set up provider authorizations as needed
4. Configure vital tracking parameters
5. Define health alert thresholds

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data should be encrypted before storage
- Access permissions are time-bound by default
- Provider verification is required for data access
- Emergency access provisions are monitored and logged
- Regular security audits are recommended

## Usage Examples

### Register a New User
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-data-registry register-user)
```

### Record Vital Signs
```clarity
(contract-call? .vitals-tracker record-vital 
    VITAL-TYPE-HEART-RATE 
    u75  ;; heart rate value
    block-height 
    none ;; optional notes
)
```

### Grant Provider Access
```clarity
(contract-call? .provider-authorization grant-access 
    provider-principal 
    u86400  ;; duration in blocks
    "full"  ;; access level
    (list "vitals" "medications")  ;; data types
)
```

### Set Up Health Alert
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-alerts create-alert-threshold
    METRIC-HEART-RATE
    u100  ;; threshold value
    "gt"  ;; greater than
    SEVERITY-MEDIUM
)
```
